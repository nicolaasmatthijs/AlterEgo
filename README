AlterEgo :: Personalized Web Search
-----------------------------------

This code is the result of a research project conducted in Easter Term 2010 
in order to obtain the MPhil Computer Speech, Text and Internet Technology 
at the University of Cambridge. It investigates the use of profile based 
personalized web search using browsing history and thorough offline and 
online evaluation in a complete and self-contained research project. It 
involves the full research cycle and includes pre-research investigation, 
suggesting and implementing a new personalization strategy, capturing data, 
finding participants, two different evaluations, parameter investigation, 
comparison to previous best systems and making the developed Firefox add-on 
available for real-life usage.

This README file first gives an overview of all of the files available in this
repository (http://github.com/nicolaasmatthijs/AlterEgo). Next, a manual is 
provided that explains the different steps required to get the project up and running.

All of the code is highly configurable and extensively documented.

*********************

++ Add-On

Code for the AlterEgo Firefox add-on.

++ DataStorage

Scripts that are responsible for saving a user's browsing history into
a database.

++ Website

Files for the website that was used to present the project and recruit people
to participate in the experiments.

******************************
** 03_PersonalizationServer **
******************************

profile generation, searching, result re-ranking, evaluation and evaluation
processing. This code also includes the MIT WordNet API.

*********************
** 04_3rdPartyCode **
*********************

This folder contains references to the different 3rd party tools that were
used for the implementation of this project.

++ ccparser

The Clark & Currant statistical natural language parser is used to parse the
text present on web pages in order to extract noun phrases.

++ google-n-gram-corpus

The Google N-Gram corpus is used to estimate the number of occurences of an
N-Gram on the web.

++ memcached-1.4.5
++ redis-1.2.6

Redis is a caching framework built on top of MemCacheD that is used to store the 
Google N-Gram corpus in memory and perform extremely fast retrieval of entries from
the corpus.

++ opennlp-tools-1.3.0

The OpenNLP Tools are used for sentence splitting and tokenization to prepare text
for parsing.

++ wordnet-3.0

The lexical database WordNet is used to filter a list of terms on Part of Speech.

***********************
** 05_DataAndResults **
***********************

++ Usage Data

Summary of the data collected by the Firefox add-on. 

++ Relevance Judgements

All documents related to the relevance judgements evaluation. This contains the
document that was given to the participants in the offline relevance judgements
sessions and the processed results coming out of that.

++ Interleaving

Contains all of the results coming out of the online interleaved evaluation
session.
